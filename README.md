## Introduction

This project involves the visualization of data from two CSV files containing the prices of JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. The aim is to explore the relationship between the prices of the two stocks and identify any trends or patterns.

## Data Preparation

The first step in the project was to read in the CSV files and preprocess the data. This involved cleaning the data, converting the date column to a datetime format, and merging the two DataFrames on the date column.

## Data Visualization

The following visualizations were created using the `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries in Python:

- Line plot of the prices of JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs over time.
- Scatter plot of the prices of JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs on the same plot.
- Heatmap of the correlation between the prices of JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.

## Conclusion

Through data visualization, we were able to identify several interesting trends and patterns in the prices of JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. The line plot revealed that both stocks experienced a significant dip in prices in early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but have since recovered. The scatter plot showed a positive correlation between the prices of the two stocks, indicating that they tend to move in the same direction. Finally, the heatmap revealed a strong positive correlation between the prices of JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of data visualization in exploring and understanding complex data. With the right tools and techniques, it is possible to gain valuable insights from even the most complex datasets.
